TODO as of 11/02/21

* SmartSpy filtering is ignored.  So you cannot do requests like
  asking for only full or empty servers, specific mods, regions, players, etc.
* 'full' and 'empty' requests at the end of an OOB_SEQ packet are also ignored.
* For either of the above to work the results of game server queries need to
  be parsed and saved in the server list struct.
* It would probably make sense to save this into the gsmaster.db eventually.
* EncType 2 and EncType 'X' support.
* UT2003/2004 support.
* Get Unreal 1 and UT99 query working.
